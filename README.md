Number Guessing Game

Description
This is a simple number guessing game built using React. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess the number within three attempts. The game provides feedback whether the guess is too high or too low, and it ends when the player either guesses the correct number or runs out of attempts.
